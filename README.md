# graph-edit-distance
A set of edit distance edition methods based on graphs.
These methods allow to calculate the edition cost of an entity (for example a word),
among a big quantity of terms with less computational cost than the usual methods.

At the momento, only a normal Levenshtein algorithm is applied, but it is very easy to add new algorithm thanks to
the project structure.
